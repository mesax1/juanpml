## Project Overview

Bucket.io is a comprehensive marketing technology platform that helps businesses grow leads and increase revenue through high-converting quiz funnels. I collaborated with their team to integrate Generative AI capabilities for automated marketing funnel quiz creation, and chatbot integration.

## Key Contributions

- Integrated LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic) into existing Marketing Funnel Software and new APIs (Django).
- Implemented RAG for question answering over documents using embeddings and vector search databases.
- Created AI-driven recommendation engines for quiz result personalization
- Integrated Chatbot with memory and context to provide a more engaging and personalized experience.


## Impact

The AI-enhanced quiz funnel platform significantly improved lead quality and conversion rates for Bucket.io's clients. The intelligent optimization features resulted in higher engagement rates, better lead qualification, and increased revenue generation through more effective marketing funnels.

The funnel creation pipeline for each client reduced from 1-2 weeks of work to just 1 day.
