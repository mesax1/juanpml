## Project Overview

Bonded LP specializes in the design, installation, inspection, and certification of lightning protection systems for construction and safety applications. I worked with their team to integrate Generative AI and machine learning technologies to enhance their document inspection processes and accelerating their construction planning phase.

## Key Contributions

### Document Processing Acceleration
- Orchestrated a RAG-based workflow to process 1000-2000 pages of documents per project, to find the most 30-50 pages of documents that are relevant to the project.
- Deployed the RAG-based workflow to Vespa, as the search engine, to enable fast retrieval of the most relevant pages.
- Integrated LLMs and VLLMs to refine the results of the retrieved pages.

## Impact

Each project's documents processed with the AI-powered document processing system can save 1-2 days of fulltime employee work.
