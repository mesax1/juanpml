## Project Overview

Pentimenti.ai is a specialized platform that develops AI solutions to simplify and streamline the sales and tender process. I collaborated with their team to enhance their AI capabilities for automated proposal generation, tender analysis, and sales process optimization.

## Key Contributions

### AI-Powered Tender Analysis

- Developed content recommendation engines for proposal enhancement

## Impact

The AI-enhanced sales and tender platform significantly reduced the time and effort required for proposal preparation while improving success rates. The automated analysis and generation capabilities allowed sales teams to focus on strategy and relationship building rather than manual document processing.
