## Project Overview

Xficient is an innovative healthcare technology company focused on revolutionizing healthcare documentation through Generative AI-powered solutions. I worked with their team as an AI Consultant to develop and implement advanced AI systems for automating healthcare documentation administration.

Xficient's main product is a document processing system that uses LLMs to process healthcare administrative documents. The system leverages Generative AI to process TPA documents that are typically unstructured, scattered across formats, platforms, and systems, and require a lot of human intervention to be processed accurately.



## Key Contributions

### Evaluation System Implementation
- Designed and implemented a comprehensive evaluation framework to measure LLM performance on healthcare document processing tasks
- Created automated testing pipelines to assess accuracy, consistency, and reliability of document extraction and classification
- Established baseline metrics and benchmarks for continuous performance monitoring
- Built custom evaluation metrics and datasets specific to TPA document processing workflows

### AI Workflow Orchestration
- Architected and implemented LangGraph-based workflows to orchestrate complex document processing pipelines
- Designed modular AI workflows for different stages of document analysis, extraction, and validation
- Created robust error handling and fallback mechanisms within the AI workflow system
- Implemented monitoring and logging systems using LangSmith for workflow observability

### Systematic Performance Improvement
- Established a data-driven approach to identify system failure points and performance bottlenecks
- Created A/B testing frameworks to measure the impact of model changes and prompt engineering improvements
- Implemented feedback loops to capture and analyze system failures for continuous learning
- Developed systematic processes for prompt optimization and workflowtuning based on evaluation results
- Created comprehensive error analysis system to track failure patterns and root causes



## Impact

Through systematic evaluation and optimization, the consulting engagement resulted in measurable improvements to the document processing system's reliability and accuracy. The evaluation framework enabled the team to make data-driven decisions about system improvements, identifying specific failure points and implementing targeted solutions. The systematic approach to reliability improvement established a foundation for ongoing optimization and quality assurance.
