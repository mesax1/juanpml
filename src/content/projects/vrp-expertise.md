### Project Overview
Extensive experience in expanding vehicle routing algorithms' capabilities, converting prototypes for novel optimization algorithms into production-ready products, improving traffic/transit predictions, and developing data-driven metaheuristics for route sequencing and VRPs.

### Key Contributions
- Developed a VRP microservice for Coordinadora.
- Improved some of the ride-sharing VRP algorithms of RideCo with implementation of State-of-the-Art algorithms.
- Expanded vehicle routing algorithms' capabilities.
- Converted prototypes for novel optimization algorithms into production-ready products.
- Improved traffic/transit predictions.
- Developed data-driven metaheuristics for route sequencing and VRPs.

### Impact
- The VRP microservice for Coordinadora handles route planning for pick & delivery of >15,000 packages daily.
